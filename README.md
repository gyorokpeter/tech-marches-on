# Technology Marches On
**WORK IN PROGRESS**

When I first learned about Gartner hype cycles, I noticed that they come out every year and many entries were repeated. I had the idea that it would be useful to assemble them into a time-lapse and see as technologies traverse the cycle over time. It could also be used for a reality check - how closely did the estimates for the "time until plateau" match reality? This project was born out of that idea, so here is the animated Gartner hype cycle.

## Data
All the data was hand-filled, roughly matching Gartner's graphs that can be found on Google.

The data could use some cleanup and manual additions especially for the later years where repeated appearances become much rarer, giving less data points for a timeline.

The set of techs shown on the graph should also be cleaned up. There are some interesting techs such as self-driving cars, 3D printing or quantum computing, also infamous ones like cryptocurrency and NFT, which would be interesting to reminisce about in a few decades. But have you ever heard about "Consumer Telematics"? Why do we need dozens of variations of Adjective AI/Analytics/Cloud when just a few would suffice? Therefore I'm planning to introduce an "interesting" flag after finishing up the data entry.
